            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 25, 2015 by <a href="#">Chioke</a></p>

            <p>Every year, like most people, I try to make resolutions. No drinking for January. Write a novel in November. Cut out caffeine for (short-term) good. And like most people, it doesn't work. This year though, I want to try to make a resolution I can keep. How? Have it somehow involve eating food.</p>

              <p>I call this <b>Bwinner</b>. Bi-Weekly New Recipe. OK. I need a better catch phrase. (Yea. You had to read that a few times). But here's the deal. Essentially every two weeks, I have to search for, select and execute a new recipe. Rack of Lamb. Rissoto. Rabbit stew. Whatever floats my boat. I struggle with following directions in many aspects of my life, but especially with food. Why measure when you can do what feels right?</p>
              <p>So this is what I intend to use this blog for. Writing about, documenting and reviewing my culinary endeavors. Get excited ya'll. I know Maurice's stomach is. </p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2015 by <a href="#">Chioke</a></p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Life is a balance of holding on and letting go.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>I was definitely an overachieving kid. Not in the, "I must get all A's and beat everyone academically in my class" kinda way. More in the "Let's join every and any activity possible so I'm busy from 7am until midnight." Ballet. Jazz. Piano. Improv troupe. Musicals. Girlchoir. Church choir. Soccer (well, kinda). Volunteer program. Mock Trial. 20 hour work week. I did them all during high school. I mean, by the time 3rd grade rolled around, I had to give up softball because I didn't have enough time. But it was what I wanted.</p>
            <p>So now that I'm an adult, I'm struggling to figure out how to do the things I love, work full-time, have a social life and spend meaningful time with my husband.</p>

            <div class="extraText">
              <h2>You are <strong>not </strong>16.</h2>
                <p>I need my sleep. And unfortunately, as a 31 year old, it is no longer socially acceptable to sleep in <em>every</em> weekend until 2pm.</p>
            
              <h2>Pace Yourself.</h2>
              <p>It's easy to get excited about following your passion and trying out a new skill. But remember. A lot of this stuff you gotta pay for on your own now. And your experiences and likes might have changed. Test something out at a weekend workshop and then see if you want to invest in it. See if you'll actually attend said dance class consistantly for 3 weeks before you buy a full package. Slow. Your. Role.</p>

              <h2>You Don't Work with Your Friends.</h>
              <p>Remember high school where friends were in your classes <em>and </em>your fun extracurricular activities? Welcome to adulthood, where you are lucky if you genuinely could imagine hanging out with a coworker post-6. You gotta remember to block off time, mentally or otherwise, to get together and catch up with friends. New to a city? Well girl, that means you actually need to <em>make</em> friends. That takes time. So save some of those afterwork hours for friendship.
            
              <h2>Men are Needy. So are Women.</h2>
              <p>Absense makes the heart, blah blah blah, but after awhile, your boo's pouty faces and sad eyes will make you realize they miss you. If you're anything like me, you don't miss your boo when you're busy. But remember. They're like a hungry customer waiting for their order to come out of the kitchen.</p>

              <h2>No One's Gonna Cook for You.</h2>
              <p>If you have a friend, roomie, boo, whoever, making food for you when you're busy, awesome. Just don't tell me about it. But for most of us, if you're not making your lunch and cooking, no one else will. What does this mean? Shitty take-out food, a disappearing bank account and the loss of your "chubby" jeans. Let's not even mention weekly chores, working out and calling your mom. Save time to take care of you and your responsibilities.</p>

              <p class="blog-post-meta">November 5, 2015 by <a href="#">Chioke</a></p>

              <p>Welcome to my blog! Yes. I get blogs can be self-serving and a bit narcisistic. Did I even spell that right? Who knows. But here's the deal. I like writing. When I lived in Vietnam, it was a way for me to talk about my random adventures and encounters, all while keeping up with my family and friends. Since then, every few years, I've tried to start a blog. Here's my start.</p>
